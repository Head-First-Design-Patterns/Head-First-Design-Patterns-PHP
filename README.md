 # Head First Design Patterns in PHP
##Someone has already solved your problems

These patterns are ported from the Java examples in the O'Reilly book ["Head First Design Patterns"](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfdp/).

## OO Basics
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance

## OO Principles
* Encapsulate what varies
* Favor composition over inheritance
* Program to interfaces, not implementations
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.
* Only talk to your friends.
* Don't call us, we'll call you.
* A class should have only one reason to change.
