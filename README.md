* [Strategy Pattern](https://github.com/jasperstone/DesignPatterns_PHP/blob/master/StrategyPattern.php) - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
* [Observer Pattern](/blob/master/ObserverPattern.php) - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically
